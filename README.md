Conway's Game of Life is a zero player game which needs no further user input other than an initial state.
From there the rules of the game dictate what happens next. 

Those rules are:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies from underpopulation

Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on

Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies from overpopulation

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell from reproduction
